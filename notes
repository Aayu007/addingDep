Class 1
Cucumber -

BDD - behavioral driven development

gherkin

group id - org.syntax
artifact id - hrmsb19

src -
    main - to develop the application
    test - to test the application

    delete main folder because we don't need it

    in test - we have
        java - for technical stuff
        resources - for non technical stuff

now we have - java, selenium, cucumber, apache, commons io


scenario - BDD -
the file where we write BDD scenarios, we call it feature file

In one user story - we have multiple test cases
similarly, in one feature file, we write multiple scenarios for that user story

 rules of steps - dont add any space or any char after implementing step definition
 dont write duplicate step def, just one step definition should exist
 you can call steps in feature multiple times, but in back-end there should be only one step
 definition


Search employee -

Search employee by id -
    Given user is navigated to HRMS application
    When user enters valid username and password
    And user clicks on login button
    Then user is successfully logged in
    When user clicks on PIM option
    And user clicks on employee list option
    When user enters valid employee id
    And user clicks on search button
    Then user see the employee information


we have scenarios written in feature file
we have step definitions in steps classes

all test scenarios are executing properly

we are calling methods from common methods class
we are using selenium webdriver from common methods class

runner class - it is considered as the most important class of cucumber

3 important classes in cucumber
feature file
step definition

runner class - we can execute all of the scenarios, some of the scenarios,
one of the scenarios from this class
we can generate all the step definitions in just one click
we can generate reports also from this class
we can separate scenarios also from this class
